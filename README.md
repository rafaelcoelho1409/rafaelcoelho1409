# About me
I am Rafael, a Brazilian mathematics student who is passionated for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I also like other tech areas as Cybersecurity and Robotics. In this moment, I'm looking for learning more about Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. In a long term, I want to contribute with Medicine area using DS & AI as solution tools.
